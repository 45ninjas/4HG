# Redcat Remote

There is an alternative remote for this repository hosted at `gitsvr@tomp.id.au:repositories/games/2019/9to5grind.git`

**If it's in-appropriate to host this project on github Redcat is the next in line.**

To add this remote use the following command.
`git remote add redcat gitsvr@tomp.id.au:repositories/games/2019/9to5grind.git`

## How to use

**Use `git push --all` to push to both**
*This also works for fetch and pull (I believe)*

To push to it use `git push redcat`
To fetch from it use `git fetch redcat`
To pull from it use `git fetch recat`
